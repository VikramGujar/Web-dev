                <h2>Hulk</h2>
                <p>

                    Hulk, also known as Dr. Bruce Banner, is a cornerstone of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and
                    one of its most iconic and powerful characters. The Hulk is the result of a gamma radiation
                    experiment gone awry, transforming the brilliant but reserved scientist into a gargantuan green
                    powerhouse whenever he loses control of his emotions. This duality between Banner's intellect and
                    the Hulk's raw, unbridled strength creates a unique and compelling dynamic. Throughout the MCU,
                    Banner struggles to balance his human side with his monstrous alter ego, leading to a journey of
                    self-acceptance and integration.
                    Bruce Banner's evolution in the MCU is not only a journey of personal acceptance but also one of
                    significant scientific breakthroughs and heroism. His contributions go beyond his transformations
                    into the Hulk; Banner is often the brain behind the Avengers' scientific endeavors, collaborating on
                    projects like the creation of Vision and the time-travel apparatus used in "Avengers:
                    <br>
                    Banner's internal struggle with the Hulk also highlights the theme of duality—how one can reconcile
                    seemingly opposing parts of oneself. This struggle is poignantly depicted in his relationships,
                    especially with Natasha Romanoff, who helps him find calm and control, and Tony Stark, whose
                    friendship and rivalry push Banner to new scientific and personal heights. Banner's synthesis into
                    "Smart Hulk" represents a culmination of this journey, symbolizing harmony between his human
                    intellect and the Hulk's physical power.
